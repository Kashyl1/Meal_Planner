# Meal_Planner

A Springboot java application. 
The user can add meals to his diet. 
What's more, he can use these added meals to plan his entire week.
Every added meal is saved in a database hosted by Heroku, so you won't lose your data when you leave this site.
(For now, you all have one common database. I am currently working on a method responsible for logging in so that everyone has access to their own database)

Hosting website responsible for storing our entries in the database:
